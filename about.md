I am a South Korean teenager, currently attending high school. Even though I plan to major in East Asian History, I know a little bit of coding, and interested in all things IT. I use Arch Linux as my main OS. My English skills are far superior to my coding skills, so I'm helping out in several open source projects as a translator (English -> Korean).

This is a new blog, as the page title suggests. Here, I will be posting things that I want to share with other students that might be helpful for their studies, my own reviews, and other random posts that I feel inclined to share with the world. Sorry about the lack of comments - I'll figure that out later. As of now, if you want to contact me, please find me using the information below.

You can contact me at hojunester@gmail.com.
If you want help translating your app, find me at [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/hojunester).
My old blog is over at [http://hojunester.wordpress.com](http://hojunester.wordpress.com).
